## Mapping & Visualization
OpenStreetMaps has a the tag `region` to describe - and therefore sort - areas into. This could be used to automatically find and highlight regions using their map, instead of coloring an `.svg` of a place instead. Doing this would instantly allowing the application to use compatible data describing almost any place in the world..

As a note, OpenStreetMaps also has the `boundary` tag, which can be used for e.g. administrative and postal code defined areas
